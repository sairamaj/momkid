Agenda
	- Demo  ( Build a Contacts Api manually)
	- Automating the above through ClouldFormation
	- Continous Integration Code Pipeline
	- https://github.com/sairamaj/momkid/wiki (Sample application (momkid) walk through)

    
------------------------


what is server less architecture?
	Serverless architectures allow you to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. 
	Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS. 
	You no longer have to provision, scale, and maintain servers to run your applications, databases, and storage systems
	https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/serverless-architectures-learn-more/

		No operating systems to choose, secure, patch, or manage.
 		No servers to right size, monitor, or scale out.
 		No risk to your cost by over-provisioning.
 		No risk to your performance by under-provisioning.

Accessing AWS	
-------------
	- CLI
	- Console (web interface)
	- SDK
	- ClouldFormation ( resource managements)

I have code and needs to run somewhere.Don't care what OS , configuration etc., All I will say is this is my javascript 
code and run it ( Lambda )

I need persist the data. ( Dynamo db)

I need to access this from outside ( Api Gateway)

Api GateWay -> Lambda -> Dynamo db

I need to set this up from ground up ( clouldformation)

I need to have CI( check in the code and need this new code available to be consumed) ( Code Pipeline)

Let me start by making some change in the code and let aws take care of build, test this new code and deploy.
    - open source
	- make a change
	- check-in
Lets see whether the process started or not ( code pipeline) 
while code pipeline is building lets see how we can build serverless manually to start with.

Lets do from back (DynamoDb -> Lambda -> Api Gateway)
	DynamoDb	
		- create persondemo
			- name field
			- add 2 entries
	Lambda	
		- create getPersons
		- node.js
			hard code something
			integrate dynamo db
	Api Gateway	
		- create pdemo
		- add Get Method
		- publish
	using 
		curl - getPersons
Lets see how we can automate these
	- demo.yaml
Lets do CI

SNS
	- 
Cloud logs

- if time permits go thorough
